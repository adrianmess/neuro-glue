## Description

Neuro Glue is designed to a web app with the primary function of allowing the user to create flash cards that support rich text and media. There is also a Notes section the user can utilize to save notes which also supports rich text and media.

I also want to encorporate a dictionary into the web app that allows the user to create the terms and definitions and then link or tag the terms to Notes or Flash Card sets or to the words within the Notes or Flash Cards.

## Objectives:
### Flash Cards

### Notes

  - [ ] Assign each Note to a category
